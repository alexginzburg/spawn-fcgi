- 1.6.0 -

  * Separated spawn-fcgi from lighttpd
  * Remove limits f√ºr php children; per default the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN var is not changed (php defaults to no children, one worker)
  * Modified the log messages format (more details on errors, no source line)
  * Only try to connect to unix socket (not tcp) before spawning (fixes again #1575)
  * Only disconnect from terminal in fork mode (keep stderr/stdout open in nofork mode)
